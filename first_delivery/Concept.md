### IoT Project - Water Quality Monitoring For Offshore Fish Cage

### Sapienza University of Rome – 2021

# Concept

All the details present in this document are based on the user’s point of view.

## Definition

The product is a Remote Water quality monitoring for fish cages by using Temperature, Turbidity and pH
sensors connected to the Internet. The users of this product can perform relevant actions through a
water pump as an actuator in case of water pollution, impurity and high temperature. Hence, a Red LED
as an actuator will turn on in case of high temperature. A buzzer will turn on in case of water pollution
and impurity.

## Objective

The project goal is to develop a web-application, which users can interact with the environment using
some simple On-Off buttons to stop or start the water pump. In addition, the important water
parameters like temperature, turbidity and pH can be measured in IoT device level of the product. These
data from a fish cage will be displayed in different ways in web application for the users.

## Storyboards

Two possible storyboards of this product presented in the following.

## Personas, Scenarios, Missions

The following Personas, Scenarios and Missions are related to our product, Water quality monitoring of
Fish Cage.

## Personas:

- Disabled – A disabled man as Fish farming operator
- Elderly – An old man as Fish farming operator

## Scenarios:

- Clean water and sanitation
- Industry, innovation and Infrastructure

## Missions:

- Teleportation
- Sixth Sense

### 1th Storyboard

- Persona: Disabled Man as Fish Farming Operator
- Scenario: Clean Water
- Mission: Teleportation / A web-application shows operator three important water parameters of different fish cages in different places

### 2nd Storyboard

- Persona: Old Man as Fish Farming Operator
- Scenario: Clean Water
- Mission: Sixth Sense /A web-application notifies operators by alarms based on some crucial events
  In order to have a clean water for fish cages all the time, to guarantee the fish growth and prevent fish
  death, we can consider “Disabled” or “Old” staff who work as fish farming operators. Our mission is
  having a web application, which they can monitor and control everything remotely. The web application
  is able to notify the operators for unusual events happens in the Fish cage like water pollution and
  increasing water temperature. For these two kinds of personas, it is very essential to work remotely;
  therefore, this product can be appropriate for them. They can perform stop-start actions through a
  water pump in case of water pollution, impurity and high temperature. Hence, a Red LED as an actuator
  will turn on in case of high temperature. A buzzer will turn on in case of water pollution and impurity.
  Everything is under control!
