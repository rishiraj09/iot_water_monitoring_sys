Water Quality Monitoring For Offshore Fish Cage

Abstract
Water quality influences fish growth and survival rate. The purpose of this project is to
monitor and report remotely water quality in realtime using IOT technology through
sensors and actuators connected to the internet (or cloud service).

Objective
Our goal is to develop a small, relatively inexpensive, portable device that can be
deployed in offshore for realtime water quality monitoring that could potentially reduced
the expensive and time consuming daily visits to the offshore fish cage.

Questions to focus

1. What is the problem and why do you need IoT?

Since most of the fish farming cages are located miles away in the offshore, making daily
monitoring both expensive and time consuming. Scientists and farmers need a way to
remotely observe water quality, fish feeding habit and growth on a regular basis without
having to visit the cages themselves and eventually control the offshore operations
monitoring remotely.

2. What are the connected components, the protocols to connect them and the
overall IoT architecture?

STM32 (+ Arduino ethernet module) —> Yet to discussed

Waterproof Temperature Sensor (DS18B20)
DS18B20 Digital sensor for measuring the water temperature at the sampling location.

Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) Sensor
TDS meter for measuring the soluble solids dissolved in the water at the sampling location.

Analog Turbidity Sensor
Analog turbidity sensor for measuring the suspended particles in water by measuring the
light transmittance and scattering rate which changes with the environment of total
suspended solids in water.

Analog Dissolved Oxygen Meter
Analog Dissolved Oxygen Meter for measuring the oxygen available in the water at the
sampling location.

Analog pH Meter
Analog pH Meter for measuring the pH value at the sampling location.

Telemetry System
Telemetry system —> yet to be discussed, whether to use wifi module or a radio modem.

MQTT Broker (AWS core IOT service)
MQTT Broker for data transmittance through a message broker to a cloud server (AWS
hosted)

S3 Bucket (AWS)
S3 Bucket for storing the collected data for further processing.

Web Dashboard (or Mobile application)
Web dashboard (or Mobile app) for visualising and monitoring the statistical data.

** Actuators yet to discussed.

3. What data are collected and by which sensors?
4. What kind of collective intelligence do you expect will emerge?
5. What are you going to learn and how will you act into the environment by what
actuators?
6. How are you going to measure the effectiveness of your actions into the environment?
7. What are the constraints? How often? Bandwidth? Latency? Energy? Duty Cycle?
8. What is the plan and what are the metrics (quantitative, not qualitative) to evaluate the
performance?
