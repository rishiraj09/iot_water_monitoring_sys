### Water Quality Monitoring System

**Water Quality Monitoring System** is the main component of the project. The main purpose of
this system is to collect data from the sensors placed in the remotely placed artificial
pond and send it through the **Ground Server** to the cloud server and then take actions by
sending commands to the actuators. A **Temperature sensor (DS18B20 sensor)** is used for
collecting water temperature data. An **Analog Turbidity Sensor** is used for monitoring
water impurity. An LED is used for passing light in the water. The amount of light
scattering data is used for the detection of water impurity level. Impurity of the water is
also monitored by detecting the ionised charged present in the water. **An Analog pH Sensor** is also used for measuring acidity level of the water. Two water pumps are used in
this system, one for pumping in cold water when the water temperature rises above
optimal temperature and the other one for pumping out impure water to maintain an
optimal water quality. For testing purpose a **Wifi module (ESP8266)** would be used for
transmitting data but in real life scenario **LoraWan module** to be used instead. The
sensors are controlled by **Nucleo Board (nucleo-f401re)** with **RIOT OS**, and
measurements are made using **Arduino Uno R3** board as the integration of sensors are
much easier with Arduino uno board. The communication between the boards is done
through **I2C protocol**: the Nucleo board is the **master**, it periodically asks for sensor data
to the Arduino Uno, which is the **slave**.


### Ground Server

**Ground Server** acts as a local server that aggregates streams of sensor datas from
multiple **Water Quality Monitoring Systems** and sends it to the **AWS cloud server** via **MQTT** for
further data processing. Each Water monitoring system will have a unique id for
identification.

### Dashboard

It is the highest level client side component of the project. The **Dashboard** would be
hosted on remote server **(AWS)** with **Node.js** for the server side backend runtime
environment. Backend server side runs using **Express framework** and the frontend is
written using **HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript and EJS View Engine**. All the data
collected from the sensors would be stored in **MongoDB database**. And finally the
processed data is displayed on **Dashboard** (or possibly on a **mobile app**).

### IoT Architecture

### System Architechture

![systemArchitecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30042823/114012452-a0651f80-9866-11eb-8e6b-e027067ec300.png)

The main purpose of this IoT device is to monitor three important parameters of water i.e.
pH scale, Turbidity and Temperature. The pH and Turbidity sensors monitors the impurity
of the water. The sensor data on comparison with the old data if found impure a water
pump will be activated to add pure water in the artificial pond. From the temperature sensor
data if the temperature data is high and not moderate a signal would be sent to the
operator side which will will turn on the red LED light as a Feedback to notify the rising temperature. With the
LED turned on the operator can send a signal to the water pump to add cold water in the
artificial pond to maintain the moderate temperature. A buzzer on the operator side will be turned on in case of rise in the water impurity level.
All the data will be presented in visual form through a web based dashboard which will be hosted on the cloud platform.



### SENSORS
