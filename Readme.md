### Main Idea of Product - Brief  Description

Water quality influences fish growth and survival rate. The purpose of this project is to monitor and control remotely water quality using IOT technology through sensors and actuators connected to the internet (or cloud service).Our goal is to develop a small, relatively inexpensive, portable device that can be deployed in remote Fish farm with artificial ponds for water quality monitoring that could potentially reduce time-consuming daily visits to the remote  fish farm.
