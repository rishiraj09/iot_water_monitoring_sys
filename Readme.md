# Main Idea of Product - Brief  Description

Water quality influences fish growth and survival rate. The purpose of this project is to monitor and control remotely water quality in real-time using IOT technology through sensors and actuators connected to the internet (or cloud service).Our goal is to develop a small, relatively inexpensive, portable device that can be deployed in offshore for real-time water quality monitoring that could potentially reduce time-consuming daily visits to the offshore fish cage.
