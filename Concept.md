### Water Quality Monitoring System

## Definition

The product is a Water Monitoring System for fishpond by using Temperature, Turbidity and pH sensors connected to the Internet.
The users of this product can perform relevant actions through two water pumps as actuators in case of water pollution, impurity
and high temperature.Hence, a Red LED/buzzer as an actuator can turn on in case of high temperature. A LED/buzzer can turn on,
in case of water pollution and impurity. 

## Objective

The project goal is to develop a web-application, which users can interact with the environment using 
some simple On-Off buttons to stop or start the water pumps.In addition, the important water parameters
like temperature,turbidity and pH measure in IoT device level of the product.These data from a fishpond will be displayed,
in different ways in web application for the users.

### Storyboard

In order to have a clean water for fishponds all the time, to guarantee the fish growth and prevent less fish death,
our mission is having a web application/mobile app, which Mike can monitor and control everything remotely.
The web application is able to notify Mike for unusual events are happening in the Fishpond like water pollution and increasing,
water temperature. This system makes Mike to omit commuting to the different pond places, which he is responsible for them.
In addition, he can save more by removing the cost of commuting; therefore, this product can be appropriate for him,
especially it has a great impact on fish growth. He can perform stop-start actions through water pumps in case of water pollution,
impurity and high temperature. Hence, a Red LED as an actuator can turn on in case of high temperature. A buzzer can turn on
in case of water pollution and impurity. **Everything is under control!**
